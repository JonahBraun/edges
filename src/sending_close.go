Channel Broadcast by Sending Close

// Sending a value on a channel will result in only one receive, regardless of how
// many goroutines are listening on the channel. This makes broadcasting to all
// listening channels impossible without a loop.

// However, closing a channel will result in all listeners receiving the zero value
// for the channel type. For the purpose of signaling, "sending a close" is an effective
// way of broadcast.

// Be careful not to send after you have closed the channel, for:
// "A send on a closed channel proceeds by causing a run-time panic."
// https://golang.org/ref/spec#Send_statements

// This script purposely ends in a deadlock.

	go func(c chan struct{}) {

	// This sends the zero value of the channel.
	close(c)

	c = make(chan struct{})
	wg.Add(1)

	// When doing this, do not test for a zero value to detect a close! This can be
	// confused with sending the zero value. Instead, use the comma-ok idiom. The
	// second value will be false for a nil or closed channel.
